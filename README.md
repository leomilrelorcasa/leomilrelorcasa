### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Leomil Arvi P. Relorcasa. I'm currently an IT graduating student from Bicol University.
ðŸ”­ I'm presently working on my coding, development and engineering skills.  

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning computer science (eventhough I'm an IT student because I took some interest in software engineering and development) and languages like python and JavaScript.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that can enhance my skills in the things mentioned above. 
Story Time:
This pandemic really hit me hard and I can say that I lost my passion and motivation in learning how to code, but as I am nearing the final stages of my education and I'll need to find a job that I can be passionate about, I happen to stumble upon job offers about software engineering. It ignited my fading love about the world of computers and technology so I told myself that I will work hard to learn about this job and this field. I started watching tutorials, motivational videos, guides, signed up for bootcamps and crashcourses, and finally begun coding and falling in love with it again. So join me in an ambitious, challenging, timely, yet wonderful journey of coding.
